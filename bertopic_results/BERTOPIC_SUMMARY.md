# BERTopic Analysis Summary: Federal Reserve Speeches

## Overview

This analysis applies BERTopic (semantic topic modeling) to 6,452 Federal Reserve speeches. Unlike LDA which uses bag-of-words, BERTopic uses transformer-based sentence embeddings to capture semantic meaning.

**Model Configuration:**
- Embedding model: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (sentence-transformers)
- Dimensionality reduction: UMAP (n_neighbors=15, n_components=5)
- Clustering: HDBSCAN (min_cluster_size=30, leaf selection)
- Topic reduction: 12 target topics

## Results Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total speeches | 6,452 |
| Topics found | 11 |
| Assigned speeches | 3,974 (62%) |
| Outlier speeches | 2,478 (38%) |

**Note:** The high outlier rate (38%) is typical for BERTopic on homogeneous corpora. Fed speeches share significant semantic overlap, making cluster boundaries fuzzy.

## Topic Definitions

| Topic | Speeches | Label | Top Keywords |
|-------|----------|-------|--------------|
| 0 | 1,267 | General Monetary Policy | policy, inflation, economic, community, economy, banks, rate, fed, monetary |
| 1 | 1,086 | Inflation & Growth | inflation, policy, rate, growth, economy, monetary, labor, rates, prices |
| 2 | 888 | Financial Regulation & Banking | financial, banks, risk, capital, market, banking, system, institutions |
| 3 | 216 | COVID-19 Pandemic Response | pandemic, inflation, economy, treasury, 2020, covid, market, support |
| 4 | 170 | Economic Education | education, financial, students, college, economics, school, policy |
| 5 | 115 | Payments Systems | payments, payment, system, check, electronic, digital, settlement, cbdc |
| 6 | 84 | Risk Management & Governance | risk management, internal, corporate, controls, governance, compliance, audit |
| 7 | 44 | Productivity & Technology | productivity, growth, labor, technology, technologies, capital, output |
| 8 | 36 | Dallas Fed / Regional | dallas, economy, fed, texas, inflation, dallas fed, trade |
| 9 | 36 | Basel Regulation | basel, basel ii, risk, capital, supervisors, regulatory capital, irb |
| 10 | 32 | Rural Communities | rural, college, areas, communities, workers, virginia, workforce |

## Key Observations

### Strengths of BERTopic Results:
1. **COVID-19 topic** (Topic 3) - cleanly identifies pandemic-era speeches with temporal keywords (2020, 2021, covid)
2. **Payments/CBDC topic** (Topic 5) - distinct technical topic about payment systems and digital currency
3. **Basel regulation topic** (Topic 9) - specific regulatory framework discussions
4. **Education topic** (Topic 4) - speeches aimed at students and financial literacy

### Limitations:
1. **High outlier rate (38%)** - many speeches don't fit cleanly into clusters
2. **Topic overlap** - Topics 0 and 1 both cover monetary policy/inflation (hard to distinguish semantically)
3. **Small specialized topics** - Topics 7-10 have <50 speeches each (may be too granular)

## Comparison: BERTopic vs Improved LDA (K=8)

| Aspect | BERTopic | LDA (K=8) |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Coverage | 62% (38% outliers) | 100% |
| Topics | 11 | 8 |
| Approach | Semantic embeddings | Bag-of-words |
| Best for | Finding niche/specific topics | Complete coverage, time-series |
| Outliers | Yes (topic -1) | No |

**Recommendation:** Use LDA for the dashboard (100% coverage, cleaner for time-series). Use BERTopic for exploratory analysis of specific themes (COVID, payments, Basel).
